This R package, which has been developed on top of the amazing work that the
[Statnet](https://github.com/statnet) team has done, implements estimation and
simulation methods for Exponential Random Graph Models of small networks, in
particular, up to 5 vertices for directed graphs and 7 for undirected networks.
In the case of small networks, the calculation of the likelihood of ERGMs becomes
computationally feasible, which allows us
avoiding approximations and do exact calculation, ultimately obtaining MLEs
directly.

## Installation

The development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("muriteams/ergmito")

the following https://github.com/fxcoudert/gfortran-for-macOS/releases

# Examples

## Quick run

In the following example we simulate a small network with 4 vertices and estimate
the model parameters using `ergm` and `ergmito`. We start by generating the graph

```{r net2}
# Generating a small graph
library(ergmito)
library(ergm)
library(sna)

set.seed(12123)
n   <- 4
net <- rbernoulli(n, p = .3)
gplot(net)
```

To estimate the model

```{r model2-ergmito}
model <- net ~ edges + istar(2)

# ERGMito (estimation via MLE)
ans_ergmito <- ergmito(model)
```

```{r model2-ergm}
# ERGM (estimation via MC-MLE)
ans_ergm  <- ergm(model, control = control.ergm(
  MCMC.effectiveSize = 4000,
  seed = 444)
  )

# The ergmito should have a larger value
ergm.exact(ans_ergmito$coef, model) > ergm.exact(ans_ergm$coef, model)

summary(ans_ergmito)
summary(ans_ergm)
```

## Estimating data with known parameters

The following example shows the estimation of a dataset that is included in the package,
`fivenets`. This set of five networks was generated using the `new_rergmito` function
which allows creating a function to draw random ERGMs with a fixed set of parameters,
in this case, `edges = -2.0` and `nodematch("female") = 2.0`

```{r fivenets}
data(fivenets)

model1 <- ergmito(fivenets ~ edges + nodematch("female"))

summary(model1) # This data has know parameters equal to -2.0 and 2.0
```

We can also compute GOF

```{r fivenets-gof}
fivenets_gof <- gof_ergmito(model1)
fivenets_gof
plot(fivenets_gof)
```

## Fitting block-diagonal models

The pooled model can be also compared to a block-diagonal ERGM. The package includes
three functions to help with this task: `blockdiagonalize`, `splitnetwork`, and
`ergm_blockdiag`.

```{r blockdiag1-dgp}

data("fivenets")

# Stacking matrices together
fivenets_blockdiag <- blockdiagonalize(fivenets, "block_id")
fivenets_blockdiag # It creates the 'block_id' variable
```

```{r blockdiag-ergm1}
# Fitting the model with ERGM
ans0 <- ergm(
  fivenets_blockdiag ~ edges + nodematch("female"),
  constraints = ~ blockdiag("block_id")
  )
```

```{r blockdiag-ergm2}
ans1 <- ergm_blockdiag(fivenets ~ edges + nodematch("female"))
```

```{r blockdiag-ergmito}
# Now with ergmito
ans2 <- ergmito(fivenets ~ edges + nodematch("female"))

# All three are equivalent
cbind(
  ergm           = coef(ans0),
  ergm_blockdiag = coef(ans1),
  ergmito        = coef(ans2)
)
```

The benefit of ergmito:

```{r blockdiag-benchmark-ergm, eval=FALSE}
t_ergm <- system.time(ergm(
  fivenets_blockdiag ~ edges + nodematch("female") + ttriad,
  constraints = ~ blockdiag("block_id")
  ))
t_ergmito <- system.time(
  ergmito(fivenets ~ edges + nodematch("female")  + ttriad)
  )
```

```{r, echo=FALSE}
t_ergm <- structure(c(user.self = 5.236, sys.self = 0.072, elapsed = 5.312, 
user.child = 0.00800000000000001, sys.child = 0.02), class = "proc_time")
t_ergmito <-structure(c(user.self = 0.0359999999999996, sys.self = 0.012, 
elapsed = 0.0479999999999983, user.child = 0, sys.child = 0), class = "proc_time")
```


```{r blockdiag-benchmark-vs}
# Relative elapsed time
(t_ergm/t_ergmito)[3]
```

## Fitting a large model

Suppose that we have a large sample of small networks (ego from Facebook, Twitter, etc.), 20,000 which account for 80,000 vertices:

```{r large-dgp}
set.seed(123)
bignet <- rbernoulli(sample(3:5, 20000, replace = TRUE))

# Number of vertices
sum(nvertex(bignet))
```

We can fit this model in a memory efficient way.

```{r large-fit, cache=TRUE}
system.time(ans0 <- ergmito(bignet ~ edges + mutual))
summary(ans0)
```

## Using interaction effects

One advantage of using exact statistics is the fact that we have significantly more flexibility when it comes to specifying sufficient statistics. Just like one would do when working with Generalized Linear Models in R (the "glm" function), users can alter the specified formula adding arbitrary offsets (using the offset function), or creating new terms by using the "I" function. In this brief example, where we will estimate a model that includes networks of size four and five, we will add an interaction effect between the edge-count statistic and the indicator function that equals one if the network is of size 5.  This way, while poling the data, we will still be able to obtain different edge-count estimates depending on the number of vertices in the graph.

```{r}
# Simulating networks of different sizes
set.seed(12344)
nets <- rbernoulli(c(rep(4, 10), rep(5, 10)), c(rep(.2, 10), rep(.1, 10)))
```

Fitting an ergmito under the Bernoulli model

```{r}
ans0 <- ergmito(nets ~ edges)
summary(ans0)
```

Fitting the model including a reference term for networks of size 5.
Notice that the variable -n- and other graph attributes can be used
with -model_update-.

```{r}
ans1 <- ergmito(nets ~ edges, model_update = ~ I(edges * (n == 5)))
summary(ans1)
```

The resulting parameter for the edge-count is smaller for networks
of size five

```{r}
plogis(coef(ans1)[1])   
plogis(sum(coef(ans1))) 
```

We can see that in this case the difference in edge-count matters.

```{r}
library(lmtest)
lrtest(ans0, ans1)
```
