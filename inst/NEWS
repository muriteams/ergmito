ergmito 0.3-1

-   Returning to CRAN. Minor fixes correcting issues with CLANG.

ergmito 0.3-0

-   Added a NEWS.md file to track changes to the package.

-   A new argument model_update has been added to ergmito,
    ergmito_formulae, and gof_ergmito (GOF_update). This new feature
    allows users adding offset terms (which is now supported) and
    arbitrary updates to the model, for example, including interaction
    terms.

-   Fixed bug in ergmito_boot. The covariance matrix was estimated with
    the wrong sample, sometimes taking observations with missing.

-   Better memory management: ergmito_ptr (a C++ class) was duplicating
    memory when it was not supposed to. A new implementation avoids
    copying memory and thus makes it faster when trying to fit a larger
    object.

-   The dots in the function parameter target.stats, stats.statmat, and
    stats.weights have been replaces with underscores (better naming
    practices).

-   A new benchmark function has been added, benchmarkito. The idea is
    to have a dependency-free way to run benchmarks. This is not the
    most accurate alternative, but is good enough for the package.

-   The function new_rergmito has been refactored.
