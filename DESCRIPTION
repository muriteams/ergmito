Title: Exponential Random Graph Models for Small Networks
Description: Simulation and estimation of Exponential Random Graph Models (ERGMs)
  for small networks using exact statistics. As a difference from the 'ergm'
  package, 'ergmito' circumvents using Markov-Chain Maximum Likelihood Estimator
  (MC-MLE) and instead uses Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE) to fit 'ERGMs'
  for small networks. As exahustive enumeration is computationally feasible for
  small networks, this R package takes advantage of this and provides tools for
  calculating likelihood functions directly, meaning that in many cases both
  estimation and simulation of 'ERGMs' for small networks can be faster and 
  more accurate than simulation-based estimation methods.
Depends: R (>= 3.3.0)
